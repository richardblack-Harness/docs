### New UI for License Management in Harness CI

We’re excited to introduce an updated UI for managing your Harness Continuous Integration (CI) licenses. With the [new subscription page](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/get-started/subscriptions-licenses/subscriptions/#developer-360-modules-subscriptions), you can now easily track and assign licenses based on the number of developers using the platform, offering greater flexibility and control over your license allocation.

This update is currently being rolled out to customers, and we expect the rollout to be fully complete by mid-March.
</Info>

<Update label="May 2025">
## Version 1.80
### New features and enhancements
- **Adjustable VM Pool initialization timeout for Windows deployments** - Virtual machines may have differing startup and initialization durations across operating systems, which can lead to timeout errors in VM Pools. You can now adjust the VM initialization timeout to ensure sufficient time to initialize. (CI-15143, ZD-70731)

### Fixed issues

- Fixed an issue where build stages misinterpreted environment variables containing commas, causing incorrect parsing of buildx options. The `plugins/buildx:1.3.1` plugin now supports the `PLUGIN_BUILDX_OPTIONS_SEMICOLON` variable to allow semicolon-delimited input for options containing commas. (CI-17379, ZD-83477)

## Version 1.77

### New features and enhancements

- **Build Intelligence and Cache Intelligence are now enabled by default for newly created CI stages**, with opt-out support. Newly created CI stages will now have [Build Intelligence](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-intelligence/) and [Cache Intelligence](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence/) automatically enabled to improve build performance through caching. New [CI Default Settings](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/settings/default-settings#continuous-integration) are now available, allowing customers to disable either feature if they prefer.
- **Node20 is now supported when using `Action` step** for running GitHub Actions on Harness Cloud. This functionality is currently behind the feature flag `CI_GHA_USE_NEKTOS_V2`. Please reach out to support if you wish to enable it (CI-17217).
- **Support was added to allow push-only mode in `Build and Push` steps** - customers can now push local Docker images created in previous steps using push-only mode. This includes support for re-tagging to simplify pushing a local image to multiple container registries. [Learn more](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-without-push/) (CI-17211).
- **Improved Multiline support for output variables and secrets** - Previously, certain multiline variables containing nested double quotes were not rendered correctly, resulting in unexpected escape characters. This has been fixed by encoding the output using Base64 for accurate restoration. Using output variables and secrets requires enabling `CI_ENABLE_MULTILINE_OUTPUTS_SECRETS` feature flag. Please reach out to support if you wish to enable it (CI-17167, ZD-83514).
- **AWS and GCP connectors used for default caching storage now fully supported on K8S** - When using cache-related Intelligence features (Build Intelligence, Cache Intelligence or Docker Layer Caching) with self-hosted builds on Kubernetes infrastructure, AWS and GCP connectors used for default storage now support all available authentication methods (CI-16581).

### Fixed issues

- Fixed an issue where when using a template containing a Git Clone step, users were unable to set the repository or provider values (CI-17230, ZD-82967).
- Fixed ECR login failure when using `PLUGIN_PUSH_ONLY` and `PLUGIN_SOURCE_TAR_PATH` to push and existing image. The `plugins/kaniko-ecr:1.11.0` plugin now correctly handles ECR authentication when pushing tarballs without rebuilding the Dockerfile. (CI-17122, ZD-82370)
- Fixed an issue where where `<+codebase>` expressions (such as commitSha, repoUrl, branch) were incorrectly resolving to null when using CommitSha as the build type (CI-17163, ZD-82770).
- Resolved an issue where logs for certain steps were intermittently missing in CI pipelines, particularly in SMP environments Additional logging has been introduced in the ci-addon image to help with visibility and troubleshooting (CI-17262).

### Fixed issues

- We identified an issue where builds marked as **Ignore Failed** were incorrectly appearing under **Failed Builds** in the **Overview** page. This has now been fixed, and such builds will no longer be shown in the failed list. The **See All** page continues to work as expected, with filters applied correctly based on user selection. (ZD-79234, CI-16440)
- Fixed pipeline execution failure when log service was unreachable by adding timeouts. (CI-16484, ZD-79557)

## Version 1.75

### New features and enhancements

- Enhanced the AWS authentication mechanism in the Drone S3 plugin (`plugins/s3:1.5.3`) to provide more reliable operation across diverse target environments. (CI-16855, ZD-81366)

### Fixed issues

- Resolved an issue in Build Intelligence where an extra parenthesis was added in run steps for PowerShell containers. (CI-16922, ZD-81766)

- Added support for remote debugging on macOS ARM64 systems when using Harness Cloud VM infrastructure. (CI-16771)
- Added multipart upload and download support to Cache Intelligence’s save and restore cache steps, significantly improving performance and reliability for large cache files. This update now supports files over 5GB, up to a maximum of 10GB.
- Introduced new configurable options to control multipart behavior (CI-16493):
	- `PLUGIN_ENABLE_MULTIPART`: Enable or disable multipart handling with a default value of `false`.
	- `PLUGIN_MULTIPART_CHUNK_SIZE_MB`: Set chunk size (in MB) for each upload segment.
	- `PLUGIN_MULTIPART_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB`: Define maximum size (in MB) for a multipart upload.
	- `PLUGIN_MULTIPART_THRESHOLD_SIZE_MB`: Trigger multipart uploads only for files exceeding this size (in MB).
- Added an optional "Upload as Flat" configuration to the out-of-the-box JFrog Artifactory step. This allows users to explicitly set the `--flat` argument in the JFrog CLI by passing true or false as needed. (CI-15781)

### Fixed issues

- Fixed an issue where the default Harness image connector still depended on DockerHub, even when using a private registry. The image is now fully self-contained, ensuring compatibility with air-gapped environments. (CI-15799, ZD-76651, ZD-76970, ZD-77190, ZD-78321, ZD-79529)

- `plugins/kaniko-ecr:1.10.8`: Added three new flags to enhance the `kaniko-ecr` plugin's image handling capabilities (CI-16588):
	- `PLUGIN_PUSH_ONLY`: Enables pushing pre-built image tarball without running a build.
	- `PLUGIN_SOURCE_TAR_PATH`: Used in conjunction with **push-only** mode.
	- `PLUGIN_TAR_PATH`, `PLUGIN_DESTINATION_TAR_PATH`: Provides consistent naming with **source-tar-path**. These additions enable more flexible workflows by allowing separation of build and push operations.
- `plugins/buildx:1.2.0`: Included support for the new `PLUGIN_BUILDX_OPTIONS` flag, allowing users to pass custom options directly to buildx. (CI-16595)
- Updated the default Docker connector for new accounts to point to GAR instead of using the account-level connector (id: harnessImage). (CI-16845)

### Fixed issues

- Resolved an issue where some Harness-generated files were being downloaded to the `/harness` directory, causing errors in git operations. These files have been moved to the `tmp` directory to prevent population of the `/harness` directory. (ZD-80915, 81193, CI-16782)
