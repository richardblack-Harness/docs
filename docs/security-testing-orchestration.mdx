title : "Security Testing Orchestration"
description : "With Harness Security Testing Orchestration (STO), your pipelines can detect security vulnerabilities automatically. Harness STO enables DevOps and Security teams teams to left shift security testing as a key outcome of their DevSecOps initiative. "
---

STO orchestrates scanning, intelligently deduplicating scanner output, prioritizing remediations, and enforcing governance into your pipelines. STO puts scanning directly into your pipelines to ensure that vulnerabilities are caught and fixed before your products are ever released.
