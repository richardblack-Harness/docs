### About Harness Release Notes

- **Progressive deployment:** Harness deploys changes to Harness SaaS clusters on a progressive basis. This means that the features described in these release notes may not be immediately available in your cluster. To identify the cluster that hosts your account, go to your **Account Overview** page in Harness. In the new UI, go to **Account Settings**, **Account Details**, **General**, **Account Details**, and then **Platform Service Versions**.
- **Security advisories:** Harness publishes security advisories for every release. Go to the [Harness Trust Center](https://trust.harness.io/?itemUid=c41ff7d5-98e7-4d79-9594-fd8ef93a2838&source=documents_card) to request access to the security advisories.

##  Releasing Harness IDP 2.0 BETA

<Update label="May 2025.05.v1">


### IDP: Reimagined for Enterprise-Scale Adoption

We’re thrilled to announce the **BETA release of Harness IDP 2.0** — a big step forward in how Harness IDP is imagined, built, and adopted at scale.

**Harness IDP 2.0** isn’t just an upgrade — it’s a complete rebuild of Harness IDP to support adoption at enterprise scale, bring in stronger access control, and a better developer experience. With foundational changes across architecture, security, scalability, and usability, IDP 2.0 marks a new chapter in how Harness IDP is **built, used and managed.**

### Why IDP 2.0?

Harness IDP started as an all-in-one platform to improve the developer experience, built on top of Backstage. While **IDP 1.0** worked well, we saw that as our enterprise customers grew, they faced new challenges at scale — which led us to rethink what an **enterprise-ready IDP** truly looks like. These challenges included limited access control, lack of gradual workflow rollout, the burden of managing YAML files manually, Git rate-limiting issues due to a single connector, and a Catalog UI that couldn’t handle large-scale use cases. The system hierarchy also didn’t align with how customers structure their teams within the Harness platform.

**IDP 2.0** directly addresses these issues. It introduces more **granular access control**, **smoother rollout** capabilities, **easier entity updates without manual YAMLs**, better Git integration, and a redesigned Catalog experience. With these improvements, IDP 2.0 is ready to support enterprise teams with the flexibility and scale they need.

### What’s New in IDP 2.0?

Harness IDP 2.0 introduces core improvements across **architecture, security, scalability**, and **developer experience**, making it easier than ever to manage and scale your internal developer portal.

####  Platform Hierarchy & Granular RBAC

  />
</CardGroup>



Catalog entities and Workflows can now be created at the **Account**, **Organization**, and **Project** scopes. By default, entities at the Account scope are accessible platform-wide, while Project-level entities are scoped to the users that are added to the Project. This allows teams to manage their own components while sharing approved workflows across the org.

You can define custom roles with fine-grained permissions (Create, Edit, Read, Delete, Execute) using Harness’s native RBAC system and reusable resource groups.

</CardGroup>
The **Catalog and Workflow UIs** have been completely rebuilt for better visibility and usability:

- Scope-based filters allow users to narrow down to their team’s view.
- Catalog table supports search, sorting and pagination.
- Scorecards are now natively integrated into the Catalog view.
- Entity pages show scope, ownership, and references cleanly in the header.

IDP 2.0 introduces new APIs for direct Catalog entity creation and updates, ensuring responses properly incorporate Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and entity scope considerations.

- Complete create/read/update/delete operations are accessible via Harness APIs
- New endpoints provide scope-aware operations aligned with Harness RBAC
- Catalog Ingestion APIs remain functional as before, though RBAC will now be enforced on updated entities

### For Existing IDP 1.0 Customers: Why Upgrade?

If you're already using Harness IDP 1.0, here’s why switching to 2.0 is worth it:

- **Harness-native Platform Hierarchy**: Catalog entities and Workflows now support Account, Org, and Project scopes, with built-in granular RBAC.
- **Easier automation without YAML file**: Entities can now be created and modified inline without having to deal with the YAML file git operations and its complexities.
- **New Catalog & Workflow UI**: Newer UX, brand new Catalog table with filters and built-in entity creation UX.
- **Backstage Plugin Support**: Continue using existing plugins without any changes.
- **Automatic Upgrade**: IDP 2.0 can be enabled via a feature flag. Your existing entities will be automatically upgraded to the new model.
- **Default Upgrade Behavior**: Entities will initially live at the Account scope. You can later organize them into Org/Project scopes as needed.

Harness IDP 2.0 is purpose-built for teams ready to scale adoption across the organization — without compromising control or experience.

### Ready to Upgrade?

You’re right — **IDP 2.0 is a significant upgrade**. But we’ve ensured the transition is smooth.

To help you plan and adopt with confidence, we’ve created:

- A detailed **[IDP 2.0 Overview Guide](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/idp-2o-overview/2-0-overview-and-upgrade-path)**
- A comprehensive **[Step-by-Step Upgrade Handbook](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/idp-2o-overview/migrating-idp-2o)**

Upgrading to IDP 2.0 is a **structured 6-step process**, and our team is here to guide you every step of the way.

### \[New Feature\] Jenkins Plugin Upgrade

**\[IDP-4939\] | [Docs](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/jenkins)**



With this release, we've upgraded the **Jenkins Plugin** to its latest version. With this upgrade, support for **additional parameters** in your plugin backend configuration has been added. If you already have the plugin enabled, you can now optionally include these new parameters as needed. Here's what these parameters do:

#### 1\. [`projectCountLimit`](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/jenkins#1-projectcountlimit)[​](https://developer.harness.io/release-notes/#1-projectcountlimit "Direct link to 1-projectcountlimit")

This parameter sets the **maximum number of Jenkins projects (jobs)** that the plugin will process or retrieve for a given Jenkins instance. It helps manage performance and load by limiting the number of projects fetched.

#### Example:

```yaml
jenkins:
  baseUrl: https://jenkins.example.com
  username: backstage-bot
  projectCountLimit: 100
  apiKey: 123456789abcdef0123456789abcedf012
```

#### 2\. [`allowedBaseUrlOverrideRegex`](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/jenkins#2-allowedbaseurloverrideregex)[​](https://developer.harness.io/release-notes/#2-allowedbaseurloverrideregex "Direct link to 2-allowedbaseurloverrideregex")

This parameter specifies a regular expression pattern used to **securely override the `baseUrl`** defined in the configuration using values from the catalog annotations. This provides flexibility while adding security, ensuring only approved URLs can override the base configuration.

**Read more about this feature [here](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/jenkins).**

### \[New Plugin\] Introducing Wiz Plugin

**\[IDP-4868\] | [Docs](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/wiz)**



We’re excited to introduce support for the **Wiz Plugin** in this release!

**Wiz** is a unified cloud security platform that offers powerful prevention and response capabilities, empowering security and development teams to build faster and more securely.

With this plugin, you can seamlessly integrate Wiz into your IDP, giving you real-time visibility into newly created issues along with their status and severity.

 **Read more about the plugin [here](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/wiz).**

### \[New Plugin\] Introducing DX Plugin

**\[IDP-4869\] | [Docs](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/dx)**



We’re excited to introduce support for the **DX Plugin** as well in this release!

The DX Plugin is built to enhance the overall developer experience by streamlining the development process. It offers actionable insights, essential tools, and seamless integrations — all tailored to improve productivity and optimize your workflow.

 **Read more about the plugin [here](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/dx).**

### Feature Improvements

- Harness IDP now supports the use of a **Harness API Key** in the [Register Catalog step](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/harness-pipeline#6-register-catalog) (IDP Stage). With this feature, users can configure the API Key by selecting the "API Token" field in the Harness UI. Enabling this ensures that the API Key is utilized for catalog registration in IDP. By integrating the API Key, the pipeline execution remains seamless, ensuring it functions correctly when triggered from another pipeline or through a trigger. **Learn more about the feature [here](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/harness-pipeline#6-register-catalog)**. (Please note that this feature was a part of the NGUI release.)

### Bug Fixes

- Added support for **Mermaid diagrams** in TechDocs by integrating the Mermaid Plugin. Customers can now easily add Mermaid diagrams within TechDocs. Here's the [documentation](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/techdocs/techdocs-bestpractices/#1-using-mermaid-for-diagrams) to learn more about this use-case. \[IDP-4844\]
- Resolved an issue causing scorecard custom checks to fail incorrectly, even when in a successful state. Fixed by addressing **JEXL check** failures. \[IDP-5002\]
- Fixed an issue causing the **"title" field** to appear faded for **read-only parameters** (ui:readonly: true). Previously, users couldn't clearly view fields marked as read-only. \[IDP-4766\]

- Fixed an issue preventing users from adding **arbitrary input values** when their preferred option wasn't listed in dynamic picker dropdown values. Users can now input arbitrary values into the dynamic picker field. \[IDP-4872\]
- Resolved a validation logic issue for **Scorecard checks** when using **Harness Code**. Corrected by fixing the parser logic. \[IDP-4937\]
- Resolved a **redirection URL** issue occurring when an account with a **vanity URL** enabled IDP. Added support for multiple hosts to fix this issue. \[IDP-4415\]
- Fixed a bug that allowed users to create **duplicate scorecards** using identifiers that already exist. This issue is now resolved. \[IDP-4192\]
