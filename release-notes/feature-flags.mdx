<Update label="May">

## Relay Proxy

### Version 2.0.10.

**Fixed Issues**:

- Resolved an issue where the REDIS\_DB environment variable was not passed to the Redis client, causing the default DB to be used regardless of configuration
- Updated third-party dependencies to address security vulnerabilities identified by scanners.

#### Version 2.0.9[â€‹](https://developer.harness.io/release-notes/#version-209 "Direct link to Version 2.0.9")

**New features and enhancements**:

- Added support for rotating auth secrets without downtime or requiring SDK restarts. Previously, updating the AUTH\_SECRET invalidated existing SDK tokens. Now, you can assign a new AUTH\_SECRET and move the old one to LEGACY\_SECRETS. The Proxy will accept tokens signed with both. Once all SDKs are using tokens signed with the new secret, you can remove the legacy value.
</Update>
