## User profiles

There are four user profiles for Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition.

- **Demo:** This profile for up to 10 users is for demonstration purposes to allow you to test Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition before onboarding. This profile enables you to run up to four simultaneous executions across two modules, CI and CD.
- **Small:** This profile for up to 200 users requires a licensed version of Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition. This profile enables you to run up to 100 simultaneous executions across two modules, CI and CD.
- **Medium:** This profile for up to 1000 users requires a licensed version of Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition. This profile enables you to run up to 500 simultaneous executions across two modules, CI and CD.
- **Large:** This profile for up to 3000 users requires a licensed version of Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition. This profile enables you to run up to 1000 simultaneous executions across two modules, CI and CD.

### Profile size and module execution details
