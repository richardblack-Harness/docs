You can find your artifacts in two different ways:
- Within your registry
- Within the **Artifacts** tab

## Inside a registry

In order to find your artifact:

1. Navigate to the registry where your artifact is stored.
2. In the **Artifacts** tab, you will see a list of the artifacts in the registry.

You can see which tag was most recently pushed to the registry for this artifact based on the **Latest Version** column on the right. 

## Inside the Artifacts tab

You can also find your artifact in the **Artifacts** tab in the left navigation bar. Here, you can search for your artifact by name and filter by registry name and package type. This is a global list of artifacts and not specific to any one registry.

Clicking an artifact brings it to its [Artifact Details](/docs/artifact-registry/manage-artifacts/artifact-details) page.
