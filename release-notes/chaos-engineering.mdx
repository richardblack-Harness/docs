### About Harness Release Notes

- **Progressive deployment:** Harness deploys changes to Harness SaaS clusters on a progressive basis. This means the features described in these release notes may not be immediately available in your cluster. To identify the cluster that hosts your account, go to your **Account Overview** page in Harness. In the new UI, go to **Account Settings**, **Account Details**, **General**, **Account Details**, and then **Platform Service Versions**.
- **Security advisories:** Harness publishes security advisories for every release. Go to the [Harness Trust Center](https://trust.harness.io/?itemUid=c41ff7d5-98e7-4d79-9594-fd8ef93a2838&source=documents_card) to request access to the security advisories.
- **More release notes:** Go to [Harness Release Notes](https://developer.harness.io/release-notes) to explore all Harness release notes, including module, delegate, Self-Managed Enterprise Edition, and FirstGen release notes.

<Update label="April 2025" description="Version 1.59.0">

#### Images required

Listed below are the images to download to use [image registry with Harness Delegate](https://developer.harness.io/docs/chaos-engineering/use-harness-ce/image-registry#images-required).

- harness/chaos-ddcr:1.59.0
- harness/chaos-log-watcher:1.59.0
- harness/service-discovery-collector:0.39.0
- harness/chaos-ddcr-faults:1.59.0

#### New features and enhancements

- Added support for Windows CPU stress on Windows dual socket servers. (CHAOS-7902)
- Adds support for dynamic updates in Active Discovery and the Application Map after each discovery runâ€”new services are added, removed services are marked accordingly, and resources from newly excluded namespaces are hidden, with their services shown as removed if referenced in the Application Map. (CHAOS-7745)
- Added Windows global blackhole experiment to cause global blackhole chaos on a Windows VM. (CHAOS-7091)

#### Fixed issues

- Fixed an issue that was causing runtime input-based fault additions to fail in Kubernetes (Harness Infrastructure) experiments when using a private image registry with a secret. The system now correctly handles secrets during fault creation in these scenarios. (CHAOS-8006)
- Added an index on the `environment_id` field to improve query performance and reduce latency for operations involving environment-specific data. (CHAOS-7726)
- Updated the title header on the Getting Started page from a question format ("Create Chaos Experiments on your \_\_\_\_\_\_?") to a clear statement: "Create Chaos Experiments on your Infrastructure" for better readability and user experience. (CHAOS-7802)
- Resolved a goroutine leak in chaos-manager by properly closing response bodies, preventing memory spikes and unbounded memory usage. (CHAOS-7972)
- Corrected the experiment count display in Bulk Run on HCE-SaaS UI by replacing the hardcoded value with a dynamic variable to reflect the actual number of selected experiments. (CHAOS-7818)
