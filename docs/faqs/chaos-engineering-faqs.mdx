## General

For an overview of Harness support for platforms, methodologies, and related technologies, go to [Supported platforms and technologies](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/platform-whats-supported).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I get the Instance ID or license ID with Harness SMP?">

  Login using Admin privilege, and then navigate to **License** to find the **License ID**.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I run both serial and parallel faults while using Linux infrastructure?">

  Currently, parallel fault experiments aren't supported for Linux.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to add and manage a custom chaos hub?">

  You can navigate to chaos hubs in the chaos module and select `+ New ChaosHub`, and fill in the details regarding your public or private hub. Ensure that you have chaos hub read or write permission enabled and a GitHub connector configured for the repository you are about to connect.
  </Accordion>


  <Accordion title="How do I connect to a private chaos hub?">

  To connect to a private chaos hub repository, connect to a Harness GitHub connector through a Harness Delegate, or GitHub directly by providing your GitHub SSH key or Personal Access Token (PAT). Once this is done, you can select the connector when adding a chaos hub.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are faults different from experiments?">

  Faults refer to the failures that are injected into the target resource as part of an experiment. Whereas a chaos experiment is a set of different faults coupled together to achieve a desired chaos impact.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the possible reasons I can't see tunables in Tune Fault UI?">

  Since the tuning of a chaos experiment is highly declarative, sometimes it may cause parsing issues, these may be the possible reasons:

  - The step name of the fault and the template name might have been changed due to custom editing.
  - The step name has been removed completely.
  - The template definition has been erased.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are probes useful in an experiment?">

  A probe can help understand the underlying patterns and laws that govern the behavior of your systems, and you can use that understanding to predict or control their behavior. Probes can be used to test scenarios such as network partitioning, pod failures, and node failures, by adding additional checks, it can also be used to test the behavior of applications during such scenarios.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is resilience score affected if a few of my probes fail?">

  The weighted average of probe success percentage of each of the probe determines the value of the overall resilience score of the experiment. The value depends on the successful outcome of the probe criteria based on the type and mode selected. There are two possible values of probe success percentage for each of the probe criteria, either 0(if the criteria assertion fails) or 100(if the criteria assertion passes).

  ```bash
  Total Resilience for one single experiment = (Weight Given to that experiment * Probe Success Percentage)
  ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I have trouble creating an experiment YAML from scratch, can I generate one?">

  Yes, you can generate a YAML file by choosing the normal flow of creating an experiment (blank canvas or through a template), in the YAML/Visual toggle you can see a generated YAML based on the inputs provided by you. A generated YAML can also be downloaded after navigating to `Chaos Experiments` and clicking on `Download Experiments`.

  Additionally you can also leverage Harness [Go SDK repository](https://github.com/harness/harness-go-sdk) and generate a template.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My issue is not mentioned here, how can I report it?">

  To report an issue which is not mentioned here, head over to **Help** in Harness SaaS and click **Submit a ticket** and provide your feedback.
