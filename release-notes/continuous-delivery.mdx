## About Harness Release Notes

- **Progressive deployment:** Harness deploys changes to Harness SaaS clusters on a progressive basis. This means that the features described in these release notes may not be immediately available in your cluster. To identify the cluster that hosts your account, go to your **Account Overview** page in Harness. In the new UI, go to **Account Settings**, **Account Details**, **General**, **Account Details**, and then **Platform Service Versions**.
- **Security advisories:** Harness publishes security advisories for every release. Go to the [Harness Trust Center](https://trust.harness.io/?itemUid=c41ff7d5-98e7-4d79-9594-fd8ef93a2838&source=documents_card) to request access to the security advisories.

  #### Helm 2

  To safeguard your operations and protect against potential security vulnerabilities, Harness will launch an update to deprecate the Helm 2 binary from delegates with an immutable image type (image tag `yy.mm.xxxxx`) **later this month**. For information on delegate types, go to [Delegate image types](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-image-types).

  Helm 2 was deprecated by the Helm community in November 2020 and is no longer supported by Helm. If you continue to maintain the Helm 2 binary on your delegate, it might introduce high and critical vulnerabilities and put your infrastructure at risk.

  If your delegate is set to auto-upgrade, Harness will automatically remove the binary from your delegate. This will result in pipeline and workflow failures for services deployed via Helm 2.

  <Note>
  **Note**

  If your development team still uses Helm 2, you can reintroduce the binary on the delegate. Harness is not responsible for any vulnerabilities or risks that might result from reintroducing the Helm 2 binary.
  </Note>

  For more information about updating your delegates to reintroduce Helm 2, go to:

  - [Delegate automatic upgrades and expiration policy](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/delegates/install-delegates/delegate-upgrades-and-expiration/)
  - [Install a delegate with third-party tool custom binaries](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/delegates/install-delegates/install-a-delegate-with-3-rd-party-tool-custom-binaries/)

  Contact [Harness Support](https://developer.harness.io/release-notes/) if you have any questions.

  #### Kustomize

  To safeguard your operations and protect against potential security vulnerabilities, Harness deprecated the Kustomize 3.4.5 binary from delegates with an immutable image type (image tag `yy.mm.verno`). For information on delegate types, go to [Delegate image types](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-image-types).

  In place of Kustomize, Harness now uses the `kubectl` binary to conduct Kustomize operations. Recent enhancements (versions 1.14 and higher) have made the `kubectl` binary fully capable of supporting Kustomize operations. For more information, go to [Kustomization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

  If your delegate is set to auto-upgrade, Harness automatically removed the binary from your delegate. This will result in pipeline and workflow failures for services that use Kustomize 3.4.5.

  <Note>
  **Note**

  If your development team still uses Kustomize 3.4.5, you can reintroduce the binary on the delegate. Harness is not responsible for any vulnerabilities or risks that might result from reintroducing the Kustomize 3.4.5 binary.
  </Note>

  For more information about updating your delegates to reintroduce Kustomize 3.4.5, go to:

<Update label="May 2025">

  ## Version 1.90.0

  ### New Features and Enhancements

  - Users can now manually trigger a status refresh for Jira, ServiceNow, and Custom Approval steps using the Refresh button in the UI. This enhancement allows on-demand evaluation of approval conditions, reducing the need to wait for scheduled polling intervals. Currently, this feature is behind the feature flag `CDS_REFRESH_IN_JIRA_SERVICENOW_APPROVALS`. Contact [Harness Support](https://developer.harness.io/release-notes/) to enable the feature. (**CDS-81994, ZD-52261,54622**)
  - Harness now supports custom webhook trigger execution via the Queue Service, improving reliability and scalability. This ensures that webhook triggers are processed efficiently, even under high load, without one customer’s activity impacting others. Currently, this feature is behind the feature flag `PIPE_ENABLE_QUEUED_BASED_CUSTOM_TRIGGERS`. Contact [Harness Support](https://developer.harness.io/release-notes/) to enable the feature.(**PIPE-21872**)
  - Users can now view **Pipeline Metadata settings** directly in Pipeline Studio when using a Pipeline Template. Additionally, only the Advanced Settings defined in the template YAML are shown, providing a clearer, read-only view of relevant configuration options. For more information, refer to [Pipeline template](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/templates/create-pipeline-template/#advanced-options). (**PIPE-25136**)

  ### Fixed Issues

  - Previously, logs for the ServiceNow approval step did not display timezone information alongside time values, leading to confusion during change window evaluations.This issue us resolved. The logs now clearly show the time with timezone context to improve clarity and troubleshooting. (**CDS-110383, ZD-84604**)
  - Previously, recreating a deleted project with the same name and attempting to create a pipeline filter with a reused name resulted in an error, due to filters not being fully cleaned up on project deletion. The issue is resolved. (**PIPE-27095, ZD-83933**)
  - Previously, deployments to Azure Functions using a private Docker registry could fail due to missing environment variables and incorrect image path handling in the slot configuration. These issues caused image pull failures and required manual updates to work around. The issues are now resolved. (**CDS-109816, ZD-82474**)
  - Previously, the notifications section on the Account Overview page showed stale or incorrect job statuses and did not display active executions from non-CD modules like CI. Additionally, clicking a notification did not always redirect to the correct pipeline view. These issues are resolved. (**PIPE-26930, ZD-83413**)
  - Previously, Service PreHooks were not triggered for Kubernetes CronJob workloads during the Wait for Steady State phase, though they worked for other workload types like Deployments and StatefulSets. This issue is resolved. PreHooks now execute correctly for CronJobs. This behavior is behind the feature flag `CDS_ENABLE_STEADY_STATE_CHECK_WITHOUT_MANAGED_WORKLOADS`. Contact [Harness Support](https://developer.harness.io/release-notes/) to enable the feature. (**CDS-109379, ZD-83017**)
  - Previously, editing a global environment override could crash the UI, especially when using a custom remote store. This issue is resolved. (**CDS-107112, ZD-78749**)
  - Previously, users were unable to input key:value tags at runtime using the UI form; the values could only be provided via the YAML editor. This issue is resolved. (**CDS-110294, ZD-84446**)
  - Previously, users with both Pipeline Execute and Environment Rollback permissions were unable to access the rollback option due to incorrect resource identifiers being used in permission checks. The issue is resolved. (**CDS-110399, ZD-83656**)
  - Previously, the UI for the Terraform Cloud Run step did not support setting step variables as runtime inputs, limiting the ability to templatize the step. This issue is resolved. (**CDS-109805, ZD-83793**)
  - Previously, secrets appeared to be referenced by environments even after removal, causing confusion in the UI. This issue is resolved. A new feature flag, `CDS_OVERRIDES_DISABLE_ENV_API_UPDATES`, ensures environment variables and overrides defined in YAML are shown accurately in the configuration view. Contact [Harness Support](https://developer.harness.io/release-notes/) to enable the feature. (**CDS-109066, ZD-82141**)
  - Previously, when the environment type was updated in Git (e.g., from Pre-Prod to Prod), the change was not reflected on the Overview page in Harness, leading to inconsistent information. This issue is resolved. A tooltip has also been added to clarify the display behavior for environments synced from Git. (**CDS-108719, ZD-81687,82526**)

  ## Version 1.89.4

  ### New Features and Enhancements

  - Harness now supports including the service name and environment in the subject line of EMAIL notifications, making them searchable and context-rich. Currently, this feature is behind the feature flag `PIPE_STAGE_NOTIFICATION_ENV_SVC`. Contact [Harness Support](https://developer.harness.io/release-notes/) to enable the feature. (**CDS-83691**)
  - Harness now displays the Helm chart versions for both current and rollback artifacts during post-production rollbacks—replacing **N/A** with the actual version numbers in the UI. (**CDS-109098**)
  - Harness now supports alphabetically sorting the list of Projects, Organizations, and Accounts when configuring Approver User Groups. (**CDS-95935**)
  - Harness is introducing the **Elastigroup Blue Green Traffic Shift** step to support weighted traffic shifting for Spot Elastigroup deployments, enabling gradual rollout strategies for services with low task counts. Currently, this feature is behind the feature flag `CDS_SPOT_TRAFFIC_SHIFT`. Contact [Harness Support](https://developer.harness.io/release-notes/) to enable the feature. For more information, refer to [Elastigroup Blue-Green Traffic Shifting Step](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/deploy-srv-diff-platforms/aws/spot/spot-traffic-shifting/). (**CDS-100276**)

  ### Fixed Issues

  - Previously, the stage status label on the execution page banner would appear truncated on smaller resolution screens. The issue is resolved. (**PIPE-26698**)
  - Previously, the Insert Step configuration in older pipeline templates would not render correctly in the UI, even with the relevant feature flags enabled. The issue is resolved, and Insert Step now renders correctly in the Overview tab for updated pipeline templates with new stage versions. (**PIPE-26956, ZD-82769**)
  - Previously, when using an expression to define the repository name in the Clone Codebase step, the Branch Name field in the run form would get stuck in an infinite loading state, preventing users from selecting or typing a branch. The issue is resolved. (**CDS-109785, ZD-83118**)
  - Previously, the `CF_HOME` environment variable was changing after each `cf auth` command in subsequent tasks. This issue was caused by broken handling of login details across operations. The issue is resolved. (**CDS-108472, ZD-81227**)
  - Previously, adding an AwsLambdaFunctionDefinition manifest via YAML in the service override configuration caused the UI to break, displaying an error message and preventing further changes. The issue is resolved. (**CDS-109383, ZD-83146**)
  - Previously, the AWS CDK plugin did not properly support the AWS\_SESSION\_TOKEN environment variable when using temporary credentials from AWS STS AssumeRole. The issue is resolved. (**CDS-109505, ZD-83221**)

  ## GitOps Version 1.32, GitOps Agent Version 0.93

  ### New Features and Enhancements

  - Applications can now be [synced and refreshed using bulk actions](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/gitops/use-gitops/sync-gitops-applications#bulk-sync-and-refresh). On the applications page, there are two new buttons: **Bulk Sync** and **Refresh**. Currently, this feature is behind the feature flag `GITOPS_BULK_ACTIONS_ENABLED `. Contact [Harness Support](https://developer.harness.io/release-notes/) to enable the feature. (**CDS-58485**)

  ### Fixed Issues

  - Previously, the API for listing repositories on the agent returned all repositories on the agent; now, it only returns repositories that respect the project mapping. (**CDS-109479**, **ZD-82623**)
  - Previously, invalid application sets were flooding the GitOps Agent with update events. This has been fixed. (**CDS-109042**)

  ## Version 1.88.4

For more information, refer to [TAS Autoscaler Integration](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/deploy-srv-diff-platforms/tanzu/tanzu-app-services-quickstart#tas-autoscaler-integration). (**CDS-101502**)
  - Harness now fetches Terraform Enterprise OPA policy evaluation results and fails the pipeline stage when a policy evaluation fails, ensuring pipelines correctly enforce OPA policy compliance. Currently, this feature is behind the feature flag `CDS_TF_POLICY_EVALUATION`. Contact [Harness Support](https://developer.harness.io/release-notes/) to enable the feature.For more information, refer to [Open Policy Agent (OPA) policy support](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-infrastructure/terraform-infra/terraform-cloud-deployments/#open-policy-agent-opa-policy-support). (**CDS-97468, ZD-63823,75769**)

  ### Fixed Issues

  - Previously, the ASG Wait for Steady State step would error out with **No instance refreshes found for ASG** if the Instance Refresh completed before the step began due to a race condition. The issue is resolved. (**CDS-109659**)
  - Previously, if a serverless deployment pipeline was configured with S3 as the manifest source and the Harness image connector set to ECR, the `download-aws-s3` image wasn’t present in ECR, causing the initialization step to fail with a **not found** error. The issue is resolved. (**CDS-109537, ZD-83368**)
  - Previously, the Terraform Cloud Run step intermittently failed in Harness when running in plan‑only mode, even though the plan completed successfully in Terraform Cloud—causing the step to error out. The issue is resolved. (**CDS-109508, ZD-83111**)
  - Previously, if you added an AwsLambdaFunctionDefinition manifest via the YAML editor in service overrides (Harness File Store), the UI would break with an error and you couldn’t revert the change. The issue is resolved. (**CDS-109383, ZD-83146**)
  - Previously, disabling container log checking for Azure App Service (Web App) deployments had no effect and the log streamer would still initialize even when skipping steady state. The issue is resolved. (**CDS-109381, ZD-82885**)
  - Previously, infrastructure created via webhook auto‑creation did not trigger OPA policy evaluation even when the CDS\_OPA\_CD\_ENTITIES\_GOVERNANCE feature flag was enabled, allowing resources to bypass governance checks. The issue is resolved. (**CDS-109227, ZD-82519**)
  - Previously, after successfully deploying an application to an Azure App Service (Web App), the deployment pipeline did not receive the success signal and would time out, blocking further stages. The issue is resolved. (**CDS-109166, ZD-82534**)
  - Previously, event relay triggers failed to initialise when using HMAC authentication for project‑level webhooks—pipelines would not trigger despite valid HMAC signatures. The issue is resolved. (**CDS-109041, ZD-82328**)
  - Previously, if the ASG Wait for Steady State step began after an instance refresh had already completed on a newly created ASG, the step would error out with “No instance refreshes found for ASG” due to a race condition. The issue is resolved. (**CDS-109659**)
