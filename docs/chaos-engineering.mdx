### Resilience Testing Made Easy

Harness Chaos Engineering (HCE) module provides an end-to-end tooling to do the **Resilience Testing** in both lower and production environments. Resilience measurement of the services can be automated such that informed decisions are taken in the change management process of the Software Delivery Life Cycle or SDLC. The practice of introducing, implementing, and improvising the **Resilience Testing** is made easy by the chaos experimentation process.

Chaos experiments help in measuring the resilience of the services. Harness Chaos Engineering module comes with more than **200** different types of out-of-the-box faults using which chaos experiments can be created and orchestrated in a few minutes. Chaos Experiments give out Resilience Score as the outcome of a successful run which can be used to take informed decisions by **QA Engineers** or **Performance Test Engineers** or **SREs** in their effort to improve the resilience posture of their applications or business services.

### Resilience Posture

Resilience Posture of a module or an application or a business service is an indicator of how resilient the system is against perceived risks of failures in either software or infrastructure or the third party systems. Harness Chaos Engineering helps in building a process of automating the continuous or the on-demand measurement of Resiliene Posture. The Resilience Posture helps in taking importance decisions while making deployment changes, making new product releases, doing infrastructure upgrades and also acting as an external indicator of Reliability for end users and third party service providers.
