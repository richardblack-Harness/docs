<Note>
Progressive deployment: Harness deploys changes to Harness SaaS clusters on a progressive basis. This means that the features described in these release notes may not be immediately available in your cluster. To identify the cluster that hosts your account, go to your **Account Overview page** in Harness. In the new UI, go to Account Settings, Account Details, General, Account Details, and then Platform Service Versions. This section displays the current version of Cloud Cost Management (CCM) running on your account.

### \[New Feature\] Replacement Schedules

We have added support for replacement schedules with options: **Always, Never, or Custom**. Users can now define specific windows (e.g., Tuesdays and Fridays, 9 PM–11:59 PM IST) for bin packing operations. Currently this is only available for "Harness Pod Eviction". During these scheduled periods, node replacements and system updates may occur, temporarily affecting workload availability. So it is advisable to choose time windows that minimize impact on critical operations.

### Feature Improvements

- **Added validation for Cost Category rules during save and update operations:** The system now constructs and dry-runs queries based on the defined cost bucket rules to identify any invalid rules before saving. As a result of this additional validation step, you may experience a slight delay during Cost Category save or update actions. \[CCM-21901\]
- **Added support for quarterly reports in Perspectives:** Previously, only monthly and annual reporting options were available. With the new quarterly option, users can now receive more balanced and actionable insights per quarter.

- **Nodepool Recommendations UI changes**: "Largest Resource Requirements" has been renamed to "Minimum Resource Requirements".The positions of Preferred and Minimum resource requirements have been swapped in the UI for better clarity and consistency. Preferred resource requirements will always be greater than Minimum resource requirements. We have also added tooltips on the UI to make the UI more user-friendly. \[CCM-22826\]

### Bug Fixes

- The [Harness API for Nodepool Recommendations](https://apidocs.harness.io/tag/Cloud-Cost-Recommendations#operation/listRecommendations) previously did not return the Account ID in the response. This issue has now been fixed, and the API will include the Account ID as part of the response payload. \[CCM-21082\]
- **Improved Accuracy in Cost Category Anomaly Detection:** We’ve improved how cost category rules are applied to anomaly filters within Perspectives. This update ensures that anomalies tied to cost category rules ( combinations of AND/OR conditions) are shown more accurately. \[CCM-21712\]
- **UI enhancement for Governance Recommendations**: We’ve resolved an issue in the Governance Recommendations’ Resource Breakdown tab where Azure Resource IDs were overflowing into adjacent cells. The text now wraps onto the next line to maintain proper layout. \[CCM-22850\]

### Bug Fixes

- We have resolved an issue where, in the **Setup HTTP/HTTPS** step while creating an **AS Rule**, clicking the **Proxy** option first and then closing it would cause the **LB** option to incorrectly open the **Proxy** dialog. It will now always open the correct dialog. \[CCM-22677\]
